## 1st year Master's Christmas Project

1st Year Master's (Game Programming degree) Christmas Project
-
TOPIC: Recreate the first 5 endings of the game Reventure
-
This project was developed with Unreal Engine 5
This project was made in a month by 4 game artists and 3 game developpers in their 1st year of their respective Master's degree.
We were asked to recreate from scratch the first 5 endings of the 2D adventure game called Reventure. Our game also had to be as faithful as possible to the original game in term of art, game mechanics and game feel.
